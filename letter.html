        <h1>Dear Elijah Nathan B. Caraan,</h1>

        <p>
            First off, I would like to greet you a HAPPY NEW YEAR !! 🥳🥂 We have reached 
            the end of 2025 babyyy < 3 I am soooo very very much a happy girl YEHEYYYYYY 
            since its a new year, i’d like to enumerate the things that i am grateful for, about you in 2025: 
        </p>

        <p>
            im grateful for you ! i think more than half of this year was our overall dynamic and bonding as friends to complicated .. to mu’s. no capping but my year would not be complete if you weren’t part of it :( it was really unexpected for us to have this deep sense of connection and feelings for each other, that’s why it is very important to me. you will always have a special place in my heart no matter what 😁
        </p>

        <p>
            im also grateful for your patience, kindness, and effort putting up with me and my crazy attitude mweheheh although i might be too oa or matampuhin sometimes, you never fail to get me back with your sweet and affirming words < 3 you really mastered the art of suyo (thanks to me 😆) but on a serious note, i hope you don’t see me as a “mean” person to you :( thats js really my way of showing you affection and i won’t intentionally act like a bully huhuhu if you really dont like that, i promise to lessen it in the upcoming year okei ! 
        </p>

        <p>
            you spending time with me is also something that i am thankful for. i have someone like you to play with me any game i want without hesitation and im so so sooo happy for that :) one of my love languages is quality time so it really makes me a lucky girl to be able to play online games with my second fave person AKA you !! (si sara first heheh mwa) its so nice that you also never get mad or stressed with me (ata?) whenever i play so dumb or when i whiff sa valorant or pag namamatay ako sa minecraft or pag mabagal ako kumilos sa overcooked hehe … YOU ARE MY 4EVA GAME BUDDY / PLAYMATE / BOOSTER 4EVER AND EVERRRR            
        </p>

        <p>
            im very grateful for our relationship with each other. we have done so many things by now and this would all be part of our memories that i’ll always reminisce about. every gala we’ve had makes my heart jump and every calls we’ve had fulfills something in me and interacting with you just completes my day ! i also can’t believe that we’ve kiss each other na 😯 HAHAHAHAHA first kiss momol agad but anyway im still happy because i know that there was love behind that and it’s not js about the pleasure of feeling it. im really happy because i finally had a genuine intimate moment with someone that i can trust, care for the same way you do to me, and js everything :) to more sweet moments like that please hehhehehehehehe
        </p>

        <p>
            lastly, i would like to thank you as a person. there were difficult challenges and battles that you faced without me knowing and i am proud of you that you overcame them all. im also amazed by how productive and studious you are and lowkey wish im like that also 😞 FOR ME, you are a strong person emotionally mentally and physically ! so pls dont stop being a jolly person who is comfortable around me to be weird ^_^ i may not fully know you yet but that is what i am looking forward to yehey wowie
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, im just very grateful to what we have achieved this 2025. i honestly wouldn’t be the person that i am today without you because of all the things i learned about relationship and life from you 🫂 this was a wonderful year that i will cherish and look back with a smile. thank you for being part of my 2025 and hopefully in the succeeding years too ! my heart is so full :) thank you baby i love u mwa 😚
